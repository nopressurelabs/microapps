# microapps

Microapps is an experiment in building an application skeleton that can be easily extended.

The idea of a microapplication is vary similar to that of a microservice.

A microapp does one thing only and exposes a RESTful API. Microapps can be used together to build complex product where each element is considered as a stand-alone component.

At the moment a microapp is just a rails-api app + postgres + ActiveModel::Serializer. We would like to extend this to provide a template for building standalone micro applications.

Check the website microapps.io for more examples.
